# BMI-Calculator
 Graphical BMI Calculator using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library, designed to provide an intuitive, user-friendly interface for calculating and managing Body Mass Index (BMI) data. This project combines health data management with graphical trend analysis to give users a clear understanding of their BMI over time. Key features include:

BMI Calculation: Users input their weight and height, and the system instantly calculates their BMI, providing immediate feedback on their health status. This makes it easy to track fitness and health goals.

Multiple User Data Storage: The application stores historical BMI data for multiple users using an integrated SQLite database. This enables users to view their past entries, monitor trends, and track progress over time.

Graphical Trend Analysis: Users can visualize their BMI history through graphical representations powered by Matplotlib. The system automatically generates graphs displaying changes in BMI over time, helping users to better understand their long-term health patterns.

User-Friendly GUI: The Tkinter interface ensures that users of all technical skill levels can interact with the application easily. With simple input forms and clear visualizations, the tool is accessible and easy to use.

Statistical Insights: In addition to trend graphs, users can get statistical insights into their BMI data, such as averages, peaks, and ranges, allowing for a more in-depth analysis of their health.
Data Exporting: Users have the option to export their BMI data for further analysis or record-keeping purposes, making it a versatile tool for both personal and professional use.
